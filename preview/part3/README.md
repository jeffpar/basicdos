### Part 3: BASIC Files vs. Batch Files

There are three versions of the **PRIMES** program on the `BASIC-DOS1` diskette:
the **BAS** file previously demonstrated, a **BAT** version that uses line numbers
only as needed (as labels), and an **EXE** version that was written in assembly
language.  The source code for the assembly language version can be found in both
the BASIC-DOS [Repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/software/pcx86/bdsrc/test/primes.asm)
and [Build Machine](/build/), along with the rest of the BASIC-DOS source code.

When processing an external filename, BASIC-DOS searches for extensions in the
same order as PC DOS: **COM**, **EXE**, and **BAT**.  And if none of those
are found, it also searches for a **BAS** file.  And unlike PC DOS, you can
override the search order with an *explicit* file extension.

Let's take a look at the **BD1.BAT** batch file in the machine below.

{% include machine.html id="ibm5150" %}

As in PC DOS 2.00, an `ECHO` command has been added to control the echoing
of lines in a batch file.  However, the only `ECHO` options are *ON* and *OFF*,
because if you want to echo something else, well, BASIC already has a command
for that: `PRINT`.

You can also treat the batch file exactly like a BASIC file, with commands
like `LOAD BD1.BAT`, `LIST`, and `RUN`.

Variables, including function definitions, remain in memory after a batch file
(or BASIC program) has been run.  So the ADD function defined by **BD1.BAT**
is still available, and can be used by any BASIC command or expression typed
directly at the command prompt.  For example:

    PRINT ADD(123456,654321)

will print `777777`.  All the standard BASIC numerical, logical, and relational
operators are available as well.

Notice that BASIC-DOS 1) doesn't require function names to begin with "FN",
2) it allows them to be defined at the command prompt (ie, what IBM PC BASIC
calls "Direct Mode", aka Immediate Mode), and 3) it allows multi-line function
definitions within BASIC files, enabling the creation of more sophisticated
functions.

Also take this opportunity to experiment with BASIC-DOS line-editing, which
combines all the editing features of both PC DOS and PC BASIC, improving the
PC DOS editing experience.  Use the BASIC-DOS `HELP` command to list available
editing keys (`HELP KEYS`).
