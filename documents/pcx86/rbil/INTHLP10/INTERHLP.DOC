    description:

        Interrupt  Helper  is  a  search  and  display  utility for Ralf
        Brown's Interrupt List.  When INTERHLP is first run, it builds a
        map  of the interrupt data file.  It uses this map to display an
        index  of entries  and to  find the  selected entry for display.

    installation:

        Copy  all of the distribution files into a convenient directory.
        They  must all reside in the same  directory so that they can be
        found  by  INTERHLP.   INTERRUPT.LST  must  also  reside in this
        directory  unless specified  as part  of the  command tail.  The
        Interrupt List is distributed in many pieces (named INTERRUP.?).
        These  files must  be combined  together by  running COMBINE.BAT
        (supplied  with  most  releases  of  the  Interrupt  List) or by
        appending them to each other using COPY.

            COPY INTERRUP.A + INTERRUP.B + INTERRUP.C  INTERRUP.LST
            COPY INTERRUP.LST + INTERRUP.D + INTERRUP.E  INTERRUP.LST
            etc.

    usage:

        INTERHLP [-cX] [filename] [interrupt] ["string"]

        where:  -Cx         Selects Category 'x'
                            Note that category specifiers are case
                            sensitive!

                filename    Optional list file.  The default file name
                            is INTERRUP.LST and the default path is the
                            location of INTERHLP.EXE.

                interrupt   Optional topic code in the form:
                            INTERRUPT nn  FUNCTION nn  SUBFUNCTION nn
                            All field are optional and the field
                            specifiers can be omitted if the arguments
                            are presented in the above order.

                "string"    Optional title sub-string.

        The  first time  INTERHLP is  run (and  anytime it detects a new
        data  file), it  reads the  entire data  file (this  takes a few
        minutes!)  and builds a  map of its  contents.  It then searches
        for  the specified topic and displays it if found.  If the topic
        isn't  found, or no topic is  specified, an index of the entries
        is displayed.

        Each  line of the index  display consists of a  topic ID and the
        text of the first line of the entry.  The topic ID consists of a
        letter   which  designates  the  category  and  a  number  which
        designates  the interrupt and function.   To select a topic, use
        the  cursor keys to move the hilite bar to the desired selection
        and press the enter key or point to the selection with the mouse
        and  click the left  button.  Topics can  also be selected using
        the  search function.  This function  prompts the operator for a
        search pattern which is in the form:

            INTERRUPT nn  FUNCTION nn  SUBFUNCTION nn  "title_text"

        All fields are optional and the field designators can be omitted
        if the arguments are presented in this order.  Field designators
        can  be abbreviated.  Searches  for numeric int/func/subfunc are
        fast binary searches of the index map.  Text searches are linear
        searches  of the  first line  of each  entry which satisfies the
        numeric search criteria and are much slower.

        While  a topic is  being displayed, the  cursor keys move up and
        down  within the current  topic and to  the adjacent topics.  As
        topics  are selected, they are recorded in a history queue.  The
        operator  can  walk  back  and  forth  thru the history queue by
        pressing  F7  and  F8.   Searches  within  the topic display are
        simple text searches.

        Many  entries  in  the  Interrupt  List have cross-references to
        other entries in the form of lines starting with "SeeAlso:".  If
        the  mouse pointer is positioned on  one of these lines, and the
        left button is clicked, INTERHLP will try to find the referenced
        entry  and display it.  Note that if a category other then "all"
        is chosen, some references may not be found.

        The  entries in the Interrupt List are grouped by category.  The
        first  character of each topic code is a letter which designates
        a category.  By default, INTERHLP displays all categories.  When
        appropriate,  a category can be  selected from the CATEGORY menu
        and  only  the  entries  in  that  category  will  be displayed.
