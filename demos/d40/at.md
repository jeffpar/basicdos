The machine below is an IBM PC AT (Model 5170) with a 6Mhz 80286, 640K of memory, a Color Display, two 1.2Mb diskette drives, and a 10Mb hard disk.  It boots the BASIC-DOS 40-Column Demo diskette and runs two 40-column sessions side by side; use **SHIFT-TAB** to toggle focus.  Since the machine has a hard disk, the boot sector first displays `Press a key to start...`; press any key (or wait 5 seconds) to boot from the diskette, or press **Esc** to boot from the hard disk instead.  Unlike the PC and PC XT, the PC AT has a battery-powered real-time clock, so BASIC-DOS starts with the current date and time (type `DATE` or `TIME` to see them).
