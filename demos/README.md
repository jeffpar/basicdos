There are currently five BASIC-DOS demo configurations:

 1. [Single 25x80 session](?autoStart=true)
 2. [Two 40-column sessions](?autoMount={A:{name:"BASIC-DOS2"}})
 3. [Two 80-column sessions](?autoMount={A:{name:"BASIC-DOS3"}})
 4. [Dual monitors with single sessions](dual/)
 5. [Dual monitors with multiple sessions](dual/multi/)

The 40 and 80-column demos are configured with borders.  A double-wide border
indicates which session has keyboard focus.  Use **SHIFT-TAB** to toggle focus.

BASIC-DOS development was performed on this PC XT [Build Machine](../build/).
It's also available with [Dual Monitors](../build/dual/).
