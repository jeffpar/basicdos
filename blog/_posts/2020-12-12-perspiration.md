I originally considered blogging about the progress of BASIC-DOS on a daily
basis, but I quickly dismissed that idea, because like most programmers, I'd
much rather be writing code than documenting it, and no one would really be
that interested anyway.  The GitHub [repository](https://github.com/jeffpar/basicdos)
has all the gory details for anyone who really cares.

But, with the target release date only 8 months away now, an update is long
overdue.

### The Boot Sector

This is where development started.  And I'm happy to report that the boot
sector is in good shape.  It includes features that I don't think existed in
any version of DOS until MS-DOS 5.0:

 - **IBMBIO.COM** and **IBMDOS.COM** boot files can be anywhere in the root directory
 - The boot files can use any clusters (they don't need to be contiguous)

In addition, the boot sector will prompt you if a hard disk is detected, and
if you press the Esc key, you can boot from the hard disk instead of the
BASIC-DOS diskette.

### System Configuration (CONFIG.SYS)

The BASIC-DOS boot code also loads **CONFIG.SYS** into memory, so that
the system can be tailored to your needs.  PC DOS didn't support **CONFIG.SYS**
until version 2.0, over 1.5 years after the IBM PC and PC DOS were introduced.

Installable device drivers (using the **DEVICE** keyword) aren't supported
yet, but support does exist for the following configuration options:

  - **BOOTKEY** (eg, BOOTKEY=D to simulate pressing 'D' at the boot prompt)
  - **CONSOLE** (eg, CONSOLE=CON:40,25,0,0,1 to create a 40-column console)
  - **DEBUG** (eg, DEBUG=COM1:9600,N,8,1 to enable debug messages to COM1)
  - **FILES** (eg, FILES=20 to allocate memory for up to 20 files)
  - **MEMSIZE** (eg, MEMSIZE=32 to limit system memory usage to 32K)
  - **REM** (for remarks -- although any unrecognized line will be ignored, too)
  - **SESSIONS** (eg, SESSIONS=4 to allocate memory for up to 4 sessions)
  - **SHELL** (eg, SHELL=COMMAND.COM AUTOEXEC.BAT)
  - **SWITCHAR** (eg, SWITCHAR=- if you'd rather type "DATE -P" instead of "DATE /P")

Sessions are one of the cool new features of BASIC-DOS.  More on that below,
when I talk about the **CONSOLE** driver.

### Built-in Device Drivers (IBMBIO.COM)

**IBMBIO.COM** is the first file loaded by the boot sector, and it's little
more than the concatenation of all the standard (built-in) device drivers,
followed by a small bit code to call each driver's INIT function.  If a driver
reports that it isn't needed (eg, if no serial or parallel adapter is present),
then the driver is discarded.

If you type the `MEM /D` command, you'll see that BASIC-DOS has most of the
usual built-in DOS device drivers, although the only ones that really do
much at this point are:

  - CON (combined screen and keyboard driver)
  - COM1, COM2, etc.
  - CLOCK$
  - FDC$ (yes, BASIC-DOS block drivers can have names, too)
  - PIPE$ (ie, a true pipe device)

BASIC-DOS device drivers are very similar to DOS drivers.  For example,
they use similar header and request packet structures.  But there are also
some significant differences.  For example, PC DOS drivers never fulfilled
the promise of asynchronous I/O, even though they were designed with separate
**STRATEGY** and **INTERRUPT** entry points.  All I/O was synchronous, and
in general, input devices were polled.

In BASIC-DOS, support for asynchronous I/O is baked in.  Drivers have a
unified **REQUEST** entry point that doesn't need to preserve any registers,
and both the BASIC-DOS **CON** and **COM** drivers support interrupt-driven
I/O.

#### The Console Driver (CON)

The Console ("CON") driver is a cornerstone of **SESSIONS**, one of the
major features of BASIC-DOS.

BASIC-DOS supports a default of 4 sessions (which you can change with the
**SESSIONS** keyword in CONFIG.SYS), and each session can be configured to use
a specific portion of the screen and a specific shell.  For example, the
following pairs of lines in **CONFIG.SYS**:

    CONSOLE=CON:40,25,0,0,1
    SHELL=COMMAND.COM

and:

    CONSOLE=CON:40,25,40,0,1
    SHELL=COMMAND.COM

define two 40-column, 25-line sessions that are displayed side-by-side on
an 80-column IBM PC monitor, each running their own copy of COMMAND.COM.

![BASIC-DOS Demo #2](/assets/images/BASIC-DOS2.png)

Sessions define a *context* within which one or more DOS programs may run,
and the system automatically multitasks between sessions, providing the
benefits a multitasking operating system while also supporting the traditional
DOS application model.

At the moment, the Console driver is fairly dumb -- it will create contexts
with any size and position, without regard for other contexts, so if you
define two or more overlapping contexts, expect to see a mess on the screen.

Contexts are created by opening the "CON" device with a descriptor, which is
a string following the device name and colon; eg:

    CON:40,25,40,0,1,0

The 6 possible values in a Console descriptor are:

  1. number of columns
  2. number of rows
  3. starting column
  4. starting row
  5. border style (0 for none)
  6. adapter number (0 for default)

Context borders exist within the context, which reduces the effective number
of rows and columns by 2.  Borders provide a visual delineation of the context,
and the width of the border indicates which context has focus (ie, where keys
will be delivered).  However, they obviously come at the expense of valuable
screen real estate.

The adapter number specifies which monitor to use in a dual-monitor machine.
Adapter 0 is the default adapter (ie, the monitor the machine is configured to
use on boot).

For example:

    CONSOLE=CON:80,25,0,0,0,0
    CONSOLE=CON:80,25,0,0,0,1

defines two full-screen border-less contexts, each assigned to a different
monitor.  In this case, the presence of a blinking cursor is your sole visual
cue as to which context has focus.

#### The Serial Driver (eg, COM1)

For each serial device present in the machine, an instance of the **COM**
driver will be installed.  You can open a COM device with just the bare name
("COM1"), or with a basic descriptor ("COM1:9600,N,8,1") to initialize the
device, or with a full descriptor ("COM1:9600,N,8,1,64,128") to also enable
buffered asynchronous I/O (eg, a 64-byte input buffer and a 128-byte output
buffer).

#### The Floppy Drive Controller Driver (FDC$)

This is a block device driver specifically designed for the IBM PC's floppy
drive controller.  However, unlike the Console and Serial drivers, it does *not*
currently support asynchronous I/O.  I didn't feel like taking on that work,
so it's largely just a wrapper for the BIOS INT 13h READ and WRITE functions.

Because it relies entirely on the BIOS, it needs the DOS kernel to "lock"
the session while any disk operation is in progress, so that there's no risk
of a context-switch in the middle of a disk operation.  That obviously isn't
ideal, but again, it saves a lot of work.

However, the FDC driver does more than simply wrap INT 13h calls.  It improves
on the BIOS interfaces by supporting:

  - Partial sector requests
  - Multi-sector requests
  - Sector requests that cross 64K boundaries

Partial sector requests relieve DOS from blocking/deblocking I/O requests
using intermediate buffers.  So if an app wants just 10 bytes out of the middle
of a sector, that request can more or less go straight to the FDC driver.  And
since the driver does its own buffering, such requests can usually be satisfied
without hitting the disk again.

The BIOS supports multi-sector requests only as long as all the sectors are
on the same track; the FDC driver eliminates that requirement, by breaking
the request into multiple BIOS requests as appropriate.  Multi-sector requests
can even include partial sector requests, starting and/or stopping on
non-sector boundaries.

And finally, while the BIOS could fail a request simply because the transfer
address crossed a 64K boundary, the FDC driver automatically detects and avoids
such failures.

There's no support in the system for hard errors (eg, the familiar "Abort,
Retry, Ignore" prompts).  Any error, recoverable or otherwise, is reported
immediately back to the caller.  That'll change at some point -- probably after
I add support to the Console driver for "popup" and background display contexts.

#### BIOS Parameter Blocks (BPBs)

While the BIOS Parameter Block (BPB) is a diskette structure that wasn't
introduced until PC DOS 2.00, it seemed like an important feature to include
in BASIC-DOS.

BPBs on BASIC-DOS diskettes have a few additional fields that relieve the boot
code from making unnecessary calculations (eg, the locations of the first root
directory and data sectors), and when they are loaded into memory, they
become Extended BPBs.

Every drive is assigned an Extended BPB, which eliminates the need for other
data structures, such as Drive Parameter Blocks (DPBs) found in later versions
of PC DOS, and the FDC driver supports MEDIA CHECK and BUILD BPB operations
similar to those that PC DOS eventually supported.

BPB support means that BASIC-DOS can read any standard PC diskette, as long as
the BIOS can read it.  However, diskettes with subdirectories won't be fully
usable, at least not until the day comes -- if ever -- that BASIC-DOS supports
them.

### The DOS Operating System (IBMDOS.COM)

**IBMDOS.COM** is the second file loaded by the boot code.  It installs handlers
for all the usual INT 2xh software interrupts, the INT 30h vector for the old
"CALL 5" CP/M-style interface, and the INT 32h vector for a new set of BASIC-DOS
"utility" functions.

It supports a 12-bit FAT file system, and file operations can be performed
with either FCB-style functions or the handle-based functions introduced in
PC DOS 2.00.  However, not all planned functions have been implemented yet.
In particular, no write operations are supported, so BASIC-DOS effectively
provides a read-only file system.  This will change in the coming months.

The memory management architecture introduced in PC DOS 2.00 has been adopted
by BASIC-DOS, with one significant difference: when a program is loaded, it is
*not* allocated all available memory.  It is provided with an ample stack, so
that BASIC-DOS *never* has to switch stacks, but if the program wants more
memory, it must explicitly allocate it.

Memory allocations are not partitioned in any way.  Every allocation, regardless
of which program or session requests it, comes from the same global memory pool.

EXE files can specify a minimum load-time memory allocation, which BASIC-DOS
will try to honor.  Even COM files can request additional "heap" memory at load
time by appending a special structure and a BASIC-DOS heap signature ("BD") to
the end of the file.

Utility functions are loosely organized into a few major groups:

- string operations
- session operations
- miscellaneous operations

String operations include string-to-integer and integer-to-string conversions;
length, search, and tokenization operations; and full-featured C-style
printf and sprintf functions.  These relieve the interpreter and every BASIC-DOS
utility from having to duplicate the same functionality.  They do come at the
cost of an increased memory footprint, but the hope is that the benefits will
outweigh the cost.

Session operations provide the ability to start and stop sessions, wait for
sessions to complete, as well as traditional multitasking functions such as
yield, sleep, wait, etc.  Also note that CTRL-ALT-DEL is intercepted by the
Console driver and transformed into a session "hot key" notification; BASIC-DOS
will attempt to terminate the current program in the session with focus.

Miscellaneous operations include date/time manipulation functions, editing
functions, object enumeration functions, and more.

### The Interpreter (COMMAND.COM)

**COMMAND.COM** is intended to be a unified DOS/BASIC command interpreter
that eliminates the need for a special "batch language", "environment variables",
etc.

There's no hard-coded support for an **AUTOEXEC.BAT**, but it's easily
added with a single line to **CONFIG.SYS**:

    SHELL=COMMAND.COM AUTOEXEC.BAT

No special switches are required (eg, /P or /K).  Each copy of **COMMAND.COM**
loaded during the system initialization (aka "SYSINIT") phase remains
permanently loaded.  Unlike PC DOS, COMMAND.COM is not divided into "resident"
and "transient" sections.  Instead, it's divided into "shared" and "instance"
sections, so every copy of **COMMAND.COM** shares the same code and read-only
data, making each additional copy's footprint much smaller.

At the command prompt, you can launch DOS and BASIC programs, and type
a variety of DOS and BASIC commands.  You can define your own variables
and functions, print expressions, and even access some predefined
variables, such as MAXINT and ERRORLEVEL.

There's also limited support for pipe (`|`) and redirection (`>`) operations.
For example:

    TYPE PRIMES.BAS | CASE

will "pipe" the output of the `TYPE` command to CASE.COM, a simple BASIC-DOS
I/O filter program that upper-cases all input.  And in BASIC-DOS, these commands
are running *simultaneously*, as separate sessions sharing the same console and
file handles.

PC DOS didn't support pipe operations version 2.00, and even then, pipes were
simulated with temporary files, requiring a writable disk with enough free space
to hold all the piped output, and the filters ran sequentially.

BASIC-DOS is free of those limitations.  No disk operations are required, the
pipe filters run in parallel, and the amount of piped data can be *unlimited*.

See the `HELP` command for a list of commands implemented so far.
